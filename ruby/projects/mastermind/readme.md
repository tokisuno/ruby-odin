# mastermind/wordle like thing in ruby
This is a TOP project aimed at utilizing classes and practicing project management, along with problem solving your way through meeting the specs of a project.



- [ ] Think about how you would set this problem up!
- [ ] Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects
  the secret colors and the human player must guess them.
  Remember that you need to give the proper feedback on how
  good the guess was each turn!
- [ ] Now refactor your code to allow the human player to
  choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret
  code or the guesser.
- [ ] Build it out so that the computer will guess if you
  decide to choose your own secret colors. You may choose to
  implement a computer strategy that follows the rules of
  the game or you can modify these rules.
- [ ] If you choose to modify the rules, you can provide the
  computer additional information about each guess. For
  example, you can start by having the computer guess
  randomly, but keep the ones that match exactly. You can
  add a little bit more intelligence to the computer player
  so that, if the computer has guessed the right color but
  the wrong position, its next guess will need to include
  that color somewhere.
- [ ] If you want to follow the rules of the game, youâ€™ll
  need to research strategies for solving Mastermind.
- [ ] Post your solution below!
