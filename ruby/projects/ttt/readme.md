# Purpose
This project is to familiarize myself with the OOP nature of Ruby by diving in head-first into a simple CLI game. The goal is to figure out how to split different parts of the program into their own classes, methods, instance variables, etc.

So far all I've been doing is mapping on paper the structure of the program and going from there. It's been hard getting into a real object-oriented mindset coming from JavaScript. I know that JS does have classes and constructors and whatnot, but it doesn't feel the same as using them in a language that was designed around an object-oriented way of thinking.

It does feel pretty cool tho.
