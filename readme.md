# The Odin Project - Ruby Path
This is the main repo where I will put all of my solutions for TOP related projects.

## Why I switched from the Node pathway
- I haven't actually fully decided to switch. I just wanted to try other things while I am busy with University.
- I think the philosophy behind Ruby and Rails is really nice and mature.
- Every single Ruby developer I've talked to doesn't hate their life.
- I just want to work with something I know won't undergo extreme framework changes every 6 months.

## Progress

- [ ] Databases

- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] React
- [ ] Getting hired
